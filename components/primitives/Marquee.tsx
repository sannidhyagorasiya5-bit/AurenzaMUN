 * Kinetic ticker: it idles along on its own, is pushed further as the page
 * is scrolled down and runs back as the reader scrolls up.
 *
 * Pure CSS, no script at all. Two nested layers each slide the track by
 * exactly one group, which repeats seamlessly: the inner one on a looping
 * animation (`marquee-drift`), the outer one on the page's scroll position
 * (`marquee-scroll`, a scroll-driven animation). Both run on the
 * compositor, so the ticker keeps full speed and never stutters however
 * busy the page is or whatever the display's refresh rate. Where
 * scroll-driven animations are unsupported it simply drifts. Static under
 * reduced motion. Decorative, so aria-hidden.
