/* Two across on a phone: at one per row the roster was a half-dozen screens
   of scrolling, and the panel carries little enough — a portrait, a
   department line and a name — to halve cleanly. Below 360px it goes back to
   one, because a half-width panel there is too narrow to break the longest
   department line ("SUB-HEAD OF TECHNICALS & DEVELOPMENT") in fewer than
   three lines, and no type step small enough to fix that is worth reading.
   A centred wrapping flex row rather than a grid: nine heads over two
   columns, or eleven sub-heads over three, leave a short last row, and a grid
   would pack those leftovers against the left edge while the rows above them
   read as centred pairs. Flex lines centre themselves, so a lone panel sits
   between the two above it. `PANEL_WIDTH` holds each panel to exactly the
   column width a grid would have given it, gutters deducted, so a full row is
   unchanged; `items-stretch` (the default) keeps every panel in a line the
   same height, which is what `auto-rows-fr` did — so an announced panel and
   an empty one still read as two states of one row. */

   share of the gutters, which changes with the gap at `sm`. Each deduction
   rounds up a hundredth past the exact share: a line that adds up to exactly
   100% is one sub-pixel rounding away from wrapping a panel onto its own
   row, and the slack is far too small to see. */
